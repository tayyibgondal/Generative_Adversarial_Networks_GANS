# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the exploration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Here, I have coded the implementations of six distinct GAN architectures, including the renowned StyleGAN.

## Key Features

- **StyleGAN** 

- **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)** 

- **CycleGAN** 

- **Pix2Pix** 

- **WGAN (Wasserstein GAN)** 

- **CGAN (Conditional GAN)** 

Additional resources in the repository include notebooks for:

- Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID): Evaluate the quality of generated images with FID, a metric widely used in GAN research.

- Data Augmentation Using GANs: Learn how to use GANs for data augmentation, enhancing your dataset for better model training.
